This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Atypography Generator is a biometric font generation web application that creates typographic designs based on the Atypography Manifesto. It generates non-traditional fonts that challenge conventional reading by creating "typography that hides in plain sight."

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Single-page application** built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Class-based architecture** with `BiometricFontGenerator` as the main controller
- **Pattern-driven font generation** using mathematical arrays to define character shapes
- **Real-time SVG rendering** with configurable export options

### Font Systems
The application implements multiple font families, each with distinct visual principles:

1. **Kvar** - Grid-based patterns (H-BRUT, H-TITE, H-FIRSTBORN, V-Vertical, SQ-Square)
2. **Epetri** - Readable waveform with vertical lines of varying heights
3. **Midis** - Diagonal movement patterns (H-Horizontal, V-Vertical)  
4. **Ricetta** - Extremely stretched horizontal/vertical lines
5. **Vitkovac** - Main line with alteration lines (H-Horizontal, V-Vertical)

### Key Components
- **Pattern Systems**: Character definitions stored as mathematical arrays
- **Rendering Engine**: SVG generation with scaling, coloring, and biometric mode
- **Control System**: Font-specific UI controls that appear dynamically
- **Export System**: SVG/PNG export with transparent background support

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Serve locally (any HTTP server)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
# or
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Testing
```bash
# Open in browser
start index.html  # Windows
open index.html   # macOS
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

### Linting/Formatting
No automated tools configured - manual code review recommended.

## Font Implementation Patterns

### Adding New Characters
1. Define patterns in `get[FontName]Patterns()` methods
2. Use consistent array format for the font type:
   - **Grid fonts**: 2D arrays `[[1,0,1], [0,1,0]]`
   - **Height-based**: 1D arrays with height values `[1,2,3,0]`
   - **Coordinate-based**: Object with segments `{segments: [[0,0.8]], rows: 1}`

### Font-Specific Controls
Font-specific controls are managed through:
- HTML sections with `font-specific-section` class
- JavaScript `updateControlVisibility()` method
- Event listeners in `setupEventListeners()` method

## Key Files

### Core Files
- **`index.html`** - Main interface with all font controls and export options
- **`script.js`** - Complete font generation logic (1700+ lines)
- **`style.css`** - Responsive styling for all UI components

### Documentation Files  
- **`Atypography.pdf`, `Atypography2.pdf`, `Atypography3.pdf`, `Atypography4.pdf`** - Design specifications

## Font Generation Process

### Pattern-to-SVG Pipeline
1. **Text input** → Character array
2. **Pattern lookup** → Mathematical definitions
3. **Scaling/positioning** → SVG coordinate calculation  
4. **Rendering** → SVG element generation
5. **Export** → File download with proper formatting

### Biometric Mode
- **Joined appearance**: Minimal spacing between characters
- **Continuous flow**: Visual connections between elements
- **Architectural integration**: Designed for contexts where traditional typography appears inappropriate

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Pattern definitions**: Keep mathematical arrays clean and well-commented
- **Font generators**: Each font has its own `generate[FontName]()` method
- **UI controls**: Font-specific controls should be properly toggled in `updateControlVisibility()`
- **Export functions**: Maintain consistent filename patterns and format support

### Performance Considerations
- **Large pattern arrays**: Keep character definitions efficient
- **SVG generation**: Optimize for smooth real-time updates
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup in PNG export functions

### Visual Quality
- **Scaling**: All fonts should work well at different scale values (0.5x - 3.0x)
- **Color consistency**: Maintain proper color application across all elements
- **Rounded corners**: Use subtle rounding (`rx` property) for better aesthetics

## Deployment

### Static Hosting
The application is ready for static deployment to:
- **Vercel** (`.vercel` folder indicates previous deployment)
- **Netlify**  
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Any static host**

### Build Process
No build process required - direct deployment of HTML/CSS/JS files.

## Font Usage Philosophy

The fonts generated by this tool follow the **Atypography Manifesto** principles:
- **Challenge conventional reading** patterns
- **Integrate with architecture** and design where traditional fonts appear kitsch
- **Provide biometric appearance** for seamless environmental integration
- **Maintain readability** through pattern recognition rather than traditional letterforms

Each font system implements different strategies for achieving these goals while preserving the ability to encode and decode textual information.
