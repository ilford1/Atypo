# Epetri Font Improvements

## Overview
The Epetri font has been significantly improved based on the analysis from Atypography2.pdf to better implement the "readable waveform" concept.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Character Patterns**
- **Completely redesigned character patterns** based on the actual Atypography document (pages 54-55)
- **Added proper height variations**: 0=no line, 1=short (25%), 2=medium (60%), 3=tall (100%)
- **Added uppercase variants** with different patterns for case variation
- **Added numbers (0-9)** and punctuation marks (. , ? ! : ;)
- **Improved readability** with distinctive patterns for each character

### 2. **Weight Variations**
Added proper weight system as mentioned in the PDF:
- **Anorexic 1-3**: Ultra thin to thin variations (0.3x - 0.5x width)
- **Regular 1-2**: Standard readable thickness (0.7x - 0.8x width)
- **Bold 1-2**: Strong presence for AIRY form only (1.0x - 1.2x width)

### 3. **Form Variations**
- **TITE Form**: Compact spacing (original spacing)
- **AIRY Form**: Larger space between vertical lines (1.5x spacing)

### 4. **Index System**
- **Optional index lines**: Thin marker at the beginning of each glyph
- **Improved readability**: Helps distinguish character boundaries
- **Visual hierarchy**: Index lines use 60% opacity to avoid interference

### 5. **Technical Improvements**
- **Better line rendering**: Added subtle rounded corners (rx property)
- **Improved spacing algorithms**: Different spacing for biometric vs. separated modes
- **Weight-responsive line width**: Line thickness adapts to selected weight
- **Enhanced biometric mode**: Tighter spacing for continuous waveform appearance
- **Better word separation**: Extra spacing between words in biometric mode

### 6. **User Interface**
- **Added Epetri-specific controls**: Weight, Form, and Index options
- **Enhanced decoding guide**: Shows pattern visualization using Unicode block characters (▁▄█)
- **Real-time updates**: All controls update the font immediately
- **Weight and form indicators**: Shows current settings in decoding guide

### 7. **Visual Quality**
- **Improved aspect ratios**: Better height distribution (25%, 60%, 100%)
- **Consistent baseline**: All characters align properly
- **Better color handling**: Maintains consistency across all elements
- **Responsive scaling**: Works well at different sizes

## Character Pattern Examples

### Lowercase Letters
- `a`: [3,1,0,3] - Tall outer lines with gap
- `b`: [3,1,1,0] - Descending pattern
- `m`: [3,1,2,1,3] - Classic M shape with peaks
- `o`: [0,3,1,0] - Centered peak

### Uppercase Variants
- `A`: [3,2,0,3] - Different from lowercase
- `B`: [3,2,2,0] - Higher middle section
- `M`: [3,2,3,2,3] - All peaks elevated

### Numbers
- `1`: [3] - Single tall line
- `8`: [2,3,2] - Figure-8 suggestion

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Use AIRY form** for better readability at small sizes
2. **Enable index lines** when readability is critical
3. **Use Regular 1-2 weights** for most applications
4. **Use biometric mode** for artistic/architectural integration

### Readability Tips
- Characters are designed to be counted by vertical lines
- Height variations help distinguish between rows
- Small spaces between glyphs maintain readability
- Index lines provide clear character boundaries

## Next Steps
With Epetri now properly implemented, the system provides:
- A true "readable waveform" as described in the manifesto
- Professional weight and form variations
- Proper case handling and punctuation support
- Enhanced user control and feedback

The font now accurately represents the Atypography concept and can be used for both artistic and practical applications where traditional typography would be inappropriate or kitschy.
